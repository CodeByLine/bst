#BST - A Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme, for WordPress

**BST is a simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 3.**

*Version 2.1*

This theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.

BST had grown complicated over the years with add-ons, but today (17 Dec 2014) I have removed them, taking BST back to being a simple starter theme again. But don't worry...

###Looking for WooCommerce support, Meganav (mega-menu navbar), Hovernav (navbar dropdown on hover), and other interesting stuff?

All these modifications to BST have now been moved to BST's big brother, **BST Plus.**

##Features of BST

* *Simple, intuitive, clean code.*
* CSS, JS, functions and template parts are organized into different folders.
* **Bootstrap 3.3.1** - CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.
* **jQuery 1.11.1** enqueued - WordPress's onboard jQuery.
* A starter CSS theme - `bst.css`, enqueued. (**Don't** put your own styles in `style.css`.)
* Visual editor stylesheet - into which the same Bootstrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG).
